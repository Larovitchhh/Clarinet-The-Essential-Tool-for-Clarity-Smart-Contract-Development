3. Why Developers Use Clarinet

When creating smart contracts, developers need confidence that their logic behaves correctly before it goes live. Clarinet enables:

Fast feedback loops through local dev networks.

Immediate contract testing without relying on external testnets.

Iterative debugging with a built-in REPL.

Consistent workflow from initial code to deployment.
