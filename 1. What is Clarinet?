1. What is Clarinet?

Clarinet is the go-to development framework for Clarity smart contracts on Stacks. It provides a complete local development environment — including a private blockchain, REPL console, testing framework, and debugging tools — making it the fastest and most productive way to iterate on smart contract code.
